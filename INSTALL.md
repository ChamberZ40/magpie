# magpie Installation & Configuration Guide

> **This document is designed to be read by AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) to help users install and configure magpie.** You can feed this file directly to your AI agent.

## What is magpie?

magpie bridges local AI coding assistants to messaging platforms (Feishu/Lark, WeChat Work, **personal WeChat** via the **Weixin (ilink)** platform).

GitHub: https://github.com/ChamberZ40/magpie

**IMPORTANT: If you are an AI agent helping a user install magpie, use interactive tools (like AskUserQuestion) to guide them through configuration choices:**
- Agent selection (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, ACP)
- Platform selection (Feishu, WeChat Work, Weixin)
- API keys and authentication tokens
- Project paths and preferences

Don't guess values—always ask the user to choose via interactive prompts.

## Step 1: Install magpie

### Option A: Build from source (recommended)

Requires Go 1.25+ and Node.js (`make build` also rebuilds the embedded Web UI).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChamberZ40/magpie.git
cd magpie
make build
# Binary will be at ./magpie
```

### Option B: npm

```bash
npm install -g @chamberz40/magpie
```

The postinstall script downloads the prebuilt binary for this platform from the
matching GitHub release, so the `magpie` command becomes available globally.

### Option C: Download binary from GitHub Releases

Go to https://github.com/ChamberZ40/magpie/releases and download the binary for your platform.

Typical artifact names (check the release page for exact filenames):

- Linux: `magpie-<version>-linux-amd64` (or `.tar.gz`)
- macOS: `magpie-<version>-darwin-amd64` / `arm64`
- Windows: `magpie-<version>-windows-amd64.exe` (or `.zip`)

```bash
# Example for Linux amd64 (replace URL with the asset link from the release you chose):
curl -L -o magpie https://github.com/ChamberZ40/magpie/releases/latest/download/magpie-linux-amd64
chmod +x magpie
sudo mv magpie /usr/local/bin/
```

On macOS, you may need to remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine magpie
```

## Step 2: Install your AI Agent

magpie supports multiple local coding agents. Install at least one:

```bash
# Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Codex
npm install -g @openai/codex

# GitHub Copilot CLI
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

For **Cursor Agent**, follow the official install docs:
- Cursor Agent: https://docs.cursor.com/agent

Any other agent that speaks ACP (e.g. OpenClaw) is configured with `type = "acp"`.

Verify your selected agent works:

```bash
claude --version
codex --version
copilot --version
cursor-agent --version
```

## Step 3: Create config.toml

> **💡 Recommended: Use the Web UI** — After installing, run `magpie web` to configure the web admin and open the dashboard in your browser. You can visually create projects, add platforms, manage API providers, and even chat with your agent directly from the browser — no need to edit TOML files by hand. **Note:** `magpie web` only configures and opens the browser — you still need to run `magpie` separately to start the service.

If you prefer manual configuration, magpie looks for config in this order:
1. `-config <path>` flag (explicit)
2. `./config.toml` (current directory)
3. `~/.magpie/config.toml` (global, **recommended**)

If no config file exists, running `magpie` will auto-create a starter template at `~/.magpie/config.toml`.

**Manual config location:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.magpie
# If you cloned the repo, copy the example:
cp config.example.toml ~/.magpie/config.toml
# Or just run magpie once — it will create a starter config automatically
```

You can also use a local config in the current directory:

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

The configuration has this structure:

```toml
# Optional global settings
# language = "en"  # "en", "zh", or "" (auto-detect)

[log]
level = "info"  # debug, info, warn, error

# Each [[projects]] entry connects one code folder to one or more messaging platforms
[[projects]]
name = "my-project"

[projects.agent]
type = "claudecode"  # or "codex", "cursor", "copilot", "acp"

[projects.agent.options]
work_dir = "/absolute/path/to/your/project"
mode = "default"

# --- Claude Code mode options ---
# "default", "acceptEdits" (alias: "edit"), "plan", "auto", "bypassPermissions" (alias: "yolo")
# allowed_tools = ["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]  # optional: pre-approve specific tools

# --- Codex mode options ---
# "suggest" (default), "auto-edit", "full-auto", "yolo"
# model = "o3"  # optional: specify model

# --- Cursor Agent mode options ---
# "default", "force"

# --- GitHub Copilot CLI mode options ---
# "default", "bypassPermissions"

# Add one or more platform sections below
```

## Step 4: Configure a Messaging Platform

Choose one or more platforms to connect. Each platform requires creating a bot/app on the platform's developer console and copying credentials into config.toml.

### Feishu (Lark) — No public IP needed

Connection: WebSocket long connection (SDK auto-negotiates)

**CLI shortcut (recommended):**

```bash
# Recommended: unified entry
magpie feishu setup --project my-project
magpie feishu setup --project my-project --app cli_xxx:sec_xxx

# Force modes (usually unnecessary)
magpie feishu new --project my-project

magpie feishu bind --project my-project --app cli_xxx:sec_xxx
```

Notes:
- `setup` is the unified entry:
  - no credentials => same as `new`
  - with `--app`/`--app-id` => same as `bind`
- `setup/new` prints a terminal QR code + URL for mobile scanning.
- If `--project` does not exist, magpie creates it automatically.
- This flow fills `app_id` / `app_secret`; in QR onboarding flow, Feishu usually pre-configures permissions and event subscriptions.
- Still verify app publish status and availability scope in Feishu Open Platform.

**Setup steps:**
1. Go to https://open.feishu.cn → Console → Create Enterprise App
2. Enable **Bot** capability (App Capabilities → Bot)
3. Go to **Permissions** → add `im:message.receive_v1`, `im:message:send_as_bot`
4. Go to **Event Subscriptions** → select **WebSocket long connection mode** → add event `im.message.receive_v1`
5. Publish the app version
6. Copy App ID and App Secret

**Config:**

```toml
[[projects.platforms]]
type = "feishu"

[projects.platforms.options]
app_id = "cli_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
app_secret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**Detailed guide:** [docs/feishu.md](docs/feishu.md)

---

### WeChat Work (企业微信) — Requires public URL

Connection: HTTP Webhook (you need ngrok, cloudflared, or a server with public IP)

**Setup steps:**
1. Log in to https://work.weixin.qq.com/wework_admin/frame
2. **App Management** → Create custom app → note AgentId and Secret
3. **My Enterprise** → note Corp ID
4. In the app → **Receive Messages** → Set API Receive:
   - URL: `https://<your-public-domain>:<port>/wecom/callback`
   - Token: any random string
   - EncodingAESKey: click "Random Generate" (43 chars)
   - **Start magpie FIRST, then save** (to pass URL verification)
5. **Trusted IP** → add your server's outbound public IP
6. (Optional) **WeChat Plugin** → scan QR to link personal WeChat

**Config:**

```toml
[[projects.platforms]]
type = "wecom"

[projects.platforms.options]
corp_id = "wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
corp_secret = "your-app-secret"
agent_id = "1000002"
callback_token = "your-callback-token"
callback_aes_key = "your-43-char-encoding-aes-key"
port = "8081"
callback_path = "/wecom/callback"
api_base_url = "https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com"  # optional: override WeChat Work API base URL (for private deployments)
enable_markdown = false  # true = Markdown messages (WeChat Work app only; personal WeChat shows "unsupported")
# proxy = "http://your-vps-ip:8888"  # optional: forward proxy if your IP is dynamic
```

**Detailed guide:** [docs/wecom.md](docs/wecom.md)

### Weixin (personal, ilink) — No public IP needed

Personal WeChat uses Tencent’s **ilink bot HTTP API** (same family as OpenClaw `openclaw-weixin`). The recommended flow is CLI QR login, which writes `token` (and related fields) into `config.toml`.

1. Run:

   ```bash
   magpie weixin setup --project my-project
   ```

2. Scan the QR code (or open the printed URL) in WeChat and confirm.

3. Restart magpie, then send a message from WeChat once so `context_token` is cached.

If you already have a Bearer token, use `magpie weixin bind --project my-project --token '<token>'`.

**Detailed guide (Chinese):** [docs/weixin.md](docs/weixin.md)

---

## Step 5: Run magpie

**Open the Web UI (recommended):**

```bash
magpie web    # configure web admin & open browser (does NOT start magpie)
magpie        # start the service
```

> **Note:** `magpie web` only configures the web admin and opens the dashboard in your browser — it does **not** start the magpie service itself. You still need to run `magpie` (or `magpie --config <path>`) separately to actually start the bridge. Think of it as two steps: configure first, then run.

**Important: If you are running inside a Claude Code session** (e.g., Claude Code helped you install and configure magpie), you must unset the `CLAUDECODE` environment variable before starting, otherwise Claude Code will refuse to launch as a subprocess:

```bash
unset CLAUDECODE && magpie
```

Alternatively, open a **separate terminal** and run magpie there — this avoids the issue entirely.

**Normal startup:**

```bash
# Run with config.toml in current directory
magpie

# Or specify config path
magpie -config /path/to/config.toml

# Check version
magpie --version
```

You should see logs like:

```
level=INFO msg="platform started" project=my-project platform=feishu
level=INFO msg="engine started" project=my-project agent=claudecode platforms=1
level=INFO msg="magpie is running" projects=1
```

## Step 6: Chat Commands

Once running, send messages to your bot on the configured platform. Available slash commands:

```
/new [name]      — Start a new session
/list            — List agent sessions
/switch <id>     — Resume an existing session
/current         — Show current active session
/history [n]     — Show last n messages (default 10)
/reasoning [level] — View/switch reasoning effort (Codex)
/mode [name]     — View/switch permission mode (default/edit/plan/yolo)
/quiet           — Toggle thinking/tool progress messages
/allow <tool>    — Pre-allow a tool (next session)
/provider [...]  — Manage API providers (list/add/remove/switch)
/stop            — Stop current execution
/help            — Show available commands
```

During a session, Claude may ask for tool permissions. Reply:
- `allow` or `允许` — approve this request
- `deny` or `拒绝` — reject this request
- `allow all` or `允许所有` — auto-approve all remaining requests this session

## Step 7: Enable Natural Language Scheduling (Non-Claude-Code Agents)

magpie supports scheduled tasks (cron jobs). You can always create them via slash commands (`/cron add ...`) or CLI (`magpie cron add ...`), but to let the agent **understand natural language** like "every day at 6am, summarize trending repos", the agent needs to know about magpie's cron CLI.

**Claude Code** handles this automatically via `--append-system-prompt` — no extra setup needed.

**For Codex, Cursor Agent, GitHub Copilot CLI, or an ACP agent**, add the following instructions to the agent's project-level instruction file in your project's `work_dir`:

| Agent | File to create/edit |
|-------|-------------------|
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor Agent | `.cursorrules` |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `AGENTS.md` |
| ACP agent (e.g. OpenClaw) | `AGENTS.md` |

**Content to add** (copy-paste into the file):

```markdown
# magpie Integration

This project is managed via magpie, a bridge to messaging platforms.

## Scheduled tasks (cron)
When the user asks you to do something on a schedule (e.g. "every day at 6am",
"every Monday morning"), use the Bash/shell tool to run:

  magpie cron add --cron "<min> <hour> <day> <month> <weekday>" --prompt "<task description>" --desc "<short label>"

Environment variables CC_PROJECT and CC_SESSION_KEY are already set — do NOT
specify --project or --session-key.

Examples:
  magpie cron add --cron "0 6 * * *" --prompt "Collect GitHub trending repos and send a summary" --desc "Daily GitHub Trending"
  magpie cron add --cron "0 9 * * 1" --prompt "Generate a weekly project status report" --desc "Weekly Report"

To list, run, edit, or delete cron jobs:
  magpie cron list
  magpie cron exec <job-id>
  magpie cron edit <job-id> <field> <value>
  magpie cron del <job-id>

Use `cron exec <job-id>` to run an existing scheduled task immediately; this is different from the `--exec <command>` flag used when creating a shell-command cron job.
Use `cron edit` to modify a single field instead of delete-and-recreate.
Common editable fields: cron_expr, prompt, exec, description, enabled (true/false), mute (true/false), timeout_mins (int).
Run `magpie cron edit --help` for the full field list.

Examples:
  magpie cron exec abc123
  magpie cron edit abc123 cron_expr "0 9 * * *"
  magpie cron edit abc123 enabled false
  magpie cron edit abc123 prompt "Updated daily summary task"

## Send message to current chat
To proactively send a message back to the user's chat session (use --stdin heredoc for long/multi-line messages):

  magpie send --stdin <<'CCEOF'
  your message here (any special characters are safe)
  CCEOF

For short single-line messages:

  magpie send -m "short message"
```

After adding this file, the agent will be able to translate natural language scheduling requests into `magpie cron add` commands automatically.

> **Tip:** You may want to add `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` to your `.gitignore` if you don't want magpie instructions committed to version control.

## Multi-Project Setup

A single magpie process can manage multiple projects. Each project has its own agent, work directory, and platforms:

```toml
[[projects]]
name = "backend"

[projects.agent]
type = "claudecode"

[projects.agent.options]
work_dir = "/path/to/backend"
mode = "default"

[[projects.platforms]]
type = "feishu"

[projects.platforms.options]
app_id = "cli_xxx"
app_secret = "xxx"

# Second project — using Codex
[[projects]]
name = "frontend"

[projects.agent]
type = "codex"

[projects.agent.options]
work_dir = "/path/to/frontend"
mode = "full-auto"

[[projects.platforms]]
type = "wecom"

[projects.platforms.options]
corp_id = "wwxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
corp_secret = "your-app-secret"
agent_id = "1000002"

# Third project — using Cursor Agent
[[projects]]
name = "design-system"

[projects.agent]
type = "cursor"

[projects.agent.options]
work_dir = "/path/to/design-system"
mode = "force"

[[projects.platforms]]
type = "weixin"

[projects.platforms.options]
token = "your-ilink-bearer-token"

```

## Upgrade

### Check current version

```bash
magpie --version
```

### npm users

```bash
npm update -g magpie
```

### Binary users

Check the latest release at https://github.com/ChamberZ40/magpie/releases and compare with your local version. To upgrade:

```bash
# Linux/macOS — replace with your platform suffix
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/magpie https://github.com/ChamberZ40/magpie/releases/latest/download/magpie-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/' | sed 's/aarch64/arm64/')
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/magpie
```

### Source users

```bash
cd magpie
git pull
make build
```

After upgrading, restart the running magpie process.

## Step 8: Run as Background Service (Optional)

You can run magpie as a daemon managed by the OS init system (Linux systemd user service, macOS launchd LaunchAgent, Windows Task Scheduler task).

### Install the daemon

```bash
magpie daemon install --config ~/.magpie/config.toml
```

You can also point the daemon at the directory that contains `config.toml`:

```bash
magpie daemon install --work-dir ~/.magpie
```

Optional flags: `--config PATH`, `--log-file PATH`, `--log-max-size N` (MB), `--work-dir DIR`, `--force` (overwrite existing unit). `--config` points to a config file, while `--work-dir` points to the directory containing `config.toml`.

### Linux systemd: Keep service running after SSH disconnect

When installed as a user-level systemd service (non-root), magpie runs under `user@UID.service`. By default, systemd stops this service when your last login session ends (e.g., SSH disconnect). This is controlled by the "linger" setting.

To keep magpie running persistently, enable linger for your user:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

After enabling linger, `user@UID.service` remains active even when you log out. The daemon install command will warn you if linger is not enabled.

Alternatively, you can install as a system-level service (requires root):

```bash
sudo magpie daemon install --config ~/.magpie/config.toml
```

System-level services are independent of login sessions.

### Control the service

```bash
magpie daemon start
magpie daemon stop
magpie daemon restart
magpie daemon status
```

### View logs

```bash
magpie daemon logs           # tail current log
magpie daemon logs -f         # follow (like tail -f)
magpie daemon logs -n 100     # last 100 lines
magpie daemon logs --log-file /path/to/log  # custom log file
```

Logs auto-rotate at the configured max size and keep one backup.

On Windows, `daemon install` creates a native Task Scheduler task named `magpie`.
The task runs at user logon and is also started immediately after installation. The
installer writes a small PowerShell launcher under `~/.magpie` so the scheduled
task uses the selected config directory, log file, PATH, and proxy environment.

### Uninstall

```bash
magpie daemon uninstall
```

## Additional Features

The following additional features are available:

- **Codex Agent**: OpenAI Codex CLI integration (`codex exec --json`)
- **Cursor Agent**: Cursor Agent CLI integration (`agent --print --output-format stream-json`)
- **GitHub Copilot CLI**: Copilot CLI integration (`copilot`)
- **ACP Agents**: any agent speaking the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) over stdio, e.g. OpenClaw
- **Voice Messages (STT)**: Speech-to-text via Whisper API (OpenAI / Groq / SiliconFlow). Requires `ffmpeg` and `[speech]` config.
- **Voice Reply (TTS)**: Text-to-speech via Qwen / OpenAI / MiniMax / MiMo / local providers. Requires `ffmpeg` and `[tts]` config.
- **Image Messages**: Send images to Claude Code for multimodal analysis
- **API Provider Management**: Runtime switching between API providers via `/provider` command or CLI
- **CLI Send**: `magpie send` to inject messages into active sessions from external processes

## Troubleshooting

- **"session already in use"** — A previous Claude Code process may still be running. Use `/new` to start a fresh session.
- **No response from bot** — Check `magpie` logs. Set `level = "debug"` in `[log]` for verbose output.
- **WeChat Work can't send messages** — Ensure your outbound IP is in the Trusted IP whitelist. If using a proxy, check the proxy is reachable.
- **WeChat Work can't receive messages** — Ensure your webhook URL is publicly accessible (ngrok/cloudflared running).
- **macOS binary won't open** — Run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine magpie` to remove quarantine flag.
