// Upstream printed "⭐ SPONSOR" next to every tier<=1 preset in

// relationship that does not exist — the same dangling-claim problem as the
// "exclusive discount for magpie users" copy removed from the presets file.
//
// A source-level guard rather than an output assertion: runProviderPresets
// fetches over the network, so exercising it in a unit test would make the test
// depend on connectivity. What needs protecting is that a merge from upstream
// cannot quietly restore the label.
